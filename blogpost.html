        <p>You can build a joy-filled, purposeful life, and define what enough looks and feels like for yourself. -build a right-sized life

            You can stop comparing and measuring yourself up against other people or against your own graceless, impossible standards.
            
            You can own your long-held dream and offer your small gifts. The essential work is to learn you’re capable of showing up and doing hard things. This is more important than accomplishing anything or hitting a particular goal.
            
            You can realize there is room for you here. You can honour your wiring and leverage your strengths, you don’t have to look like anyone else or know for sure where you’re heading. You can be raw and real. It is enough.
            
            You can learn to put down strong healthy roots of self-awareness and self-compassion. When we decide to love ourselves, we can love others well and affect change.
            
            You can finally tell the truth about what you want and learn to love yourself well, shift course, let go of what no longer serves, and build a joyful, purposeful life.
            
            You can forgive yourself for doing your imperfect best and shake off all the self-judgment and critical thoughts and realize that today, this simple, ordinary, beautiful day is a fresh start.
            
            You can loosen your grip on what you thought your life would look like, open wide to joyful possibility, and decide to show up every day determined, stubborn, and full of excitement.
            
            You can embrace that a full, beautiful life is also sometimes a stressful or uncertain one. That perfection and arriving are never the goal. Today is the only real promise we have.<br>
            I have no idea where the next seven years or the next seven days will lead. That isn’t my business. My business is to decide that I will show up. And the mindset with which I’ll show up. And that when life feels hard and I forget I am loved and needed, I will show up anyway.

And I get to choose joy every day.

If you’re here then I believe you’re looking for something. Maybe freedom or self-compassion or maybe you want to learn to dance with fear. Perhaps you’re seeking joy.

Maybe, you realize, you are ready to write a new story.

Step out onto the path with me and see where it leads.

We can invite joy to come along as our faithful companion. </p>
